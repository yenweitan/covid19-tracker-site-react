## ðŸš€ Introduction
This is a practice replica of a tutorial I found from Youtube. Shoutout to JavaScriptMastery.

This project is helping me practice and familiarize myself with react hooks and component concepts,
and also JavaScript and the use of API's such as axios. 
I have done react frontend designs in other projects, one notable one is a group project to build a student/professor application.
I made a state changing appointment step page for the site user to set up and appointment.

API used in this project: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api
