## ðŸš€ Introduction
This is a practice replica of a tutorial I found from Youtube. Shoutout to JavaScriptMastery.

This project is helping me practice and familiarize myself with react hooks and component concepts,
and also JavaScript and the use of API's such as axios. 
I have done react frontend designs in other projects, one notable one is a group project to build a student/professor application.
I made a state changing appointment step page for the site user to set up and appointment.

API used in this project: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

## ðŸ›  Setup:
1. Download the source file

2. run ```npm i && npm start``` 
 
## ðŸ”§ Testing tools:
Experimented and trialed with testcafe tool via a recommendation from my professor, Dr. Grebe.
Used and recorded a sample of the click selector tests to manipulate all possible user manipulated sections and data.
Easier approach compared to the common Selenium webdriver methods.
